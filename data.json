    "summary_en": "The Creative Architect revisits a fascinating 1958-59 study of mid-century architects, revealing insights into creativity through psychological testing. While it doesn't offer practical creativity recipes, it provides an inspiring historical perspective on creative minds. How to Talk to Girls at Parties is a clever graphic novel adaptation of Neil Gaiman's story, blending humor and sci-fi to explore adolescent awkwardness in social situations. Both works offer unique perspectives on human behavior and creativity, though in very different contexts. The architect study provides historical depth, while Gaiman's work offers contemporary social commentary through fantasy.",

The funeral becomes a microcosm of our polarized politics, where even in death, Cheney's choices continue to divide.

A critical insight is the emphasis on 'formidable founders' and identifying a 'promising market' as the core pillars of investor appeal, rather than a slick pitch. It challenges the conventional wisdom of 'selling' an idea, instead advocating for a deep, self-convincing evaluation of the startup's investment-worthiness.

    "summary_en": "This article critically examines Donald Trump's long-standing attitudes and behaviors towards women, juxtaposing them with the recently released 'Epstein files.' It meticulously recounts instances, from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to numerous sexual misconduct allegations and civil judgments, demonstrating a consistent pattern of disrespect and entitlement. The author compellingly argues that Trump's indecency is well-documented and doesn't require dubious new evidence, such as the recently debunked fake letter from Epstein. The piece highlights the disturbing commonalities between Trump and Epstein, particularly their shared view of women as objects for ego and dominance, as revealed in extensive reporting. It's a sobering read that delves into the societal implications of such figures, prompting reflection on public perception and accountability. The continuous denial strategy employed by Trump is also a key theme, suggesting a cynical manipulation of public belief.",

The piece highlights how Sanders, despite her own struggles with impostor syndrome, inadvertently became a powerful voice, challenging societal dismissals of women's midlife symptoms.

Instead, it argues that early-stage startups thrive by engaging in intensely manual, seemingly unscalable activities like personally recruiting users, providing hyper-attentive customer service, and even manually fulfilling product functions. The author uses examples like Stripe and Airbnb to illustrate how these 'unscalable' efforts are not just necessary evils, but foundational to building a robust product, understanding user needs deeply, and fostering a strong company culture. It's a compelling argument against premature optimization and for embracing the 'fragility' of a nascent venture, suggesting that the initial, arduous push is what truly propels a startup forward, much like hand-cranking an engine before electric starters existed. This perspective is crucial for founders who might otherwise be daunted by slow growth or feel pressured to mimic the distant, polished operations of established giants.",
    "summary_zh": "这篇文章颠覆了我们对创业的固有认知。它指出，初创公司早期成功的秘诀并非追求规模化，而是要主动投入那些看似“不可扩展”的艰苦工作，比如亲自招募用户、提供极致的客户服务。这种“手摇启动”的策略，不仅能帮助公司渡过脆弱的初创期，更能深入理解用户需求，塑造公司文化。这对我个人而言，是一个深刻的提醒：真正的创新和增长往往源于对初期的笨拙和投入，而非一开始就追求完美或宏大叙事。它揭示了成功背后那些被忽视的、脚踏实地的努力。",

The author posits that the rapid advancement of transformer-based models, particularly their self-improvement capabilities (akin to 'Seed AI'), means that AGI, and even early forms of ASI, are already here, or were very recently. The piece critiques the semantic slipperiness of these terms, suggesting that new euphemisms will inevitably emerge to avoid acknowledging the current state of AI. It provocatively highlights how current AI models surpass average human intelligence in many domains, challenging our perception of what constitutes 'superhuman' intelligence and the intellectual revolution it was supposed to bring.",

The author thoughtfully explores the factors contributing to this trend, such as concerns over immigration and public security, and contrasts Kast's understated demeanor with other flamboyant right-wing figures like Milei and Bukele. The piece is a critical examination of how historical revisionism, coupled with populist rhetoric, is reshaping the political landscape, raising profound questions about the future of democracy and human rights in the region.

I particularly appreciate the psychological insight into why peeking lace is so effective – hinting at lingerie without being overt, creating a sense of 'sartorial flirtation.' The piece provides actionable styling tips, such as pairing lace-trim skirts with matte, loose tops, or using lace bodysuits as versatile winter layering pieces, making it genuinely useful for anyone looking to refresh their wardrobe with this delicate fabric.

The author provocatively argues that while founders will gain more leverage and retain greater equity, top-tier investors stand to make more money due to a projected increase in the number of 'big hit' startups. The analysis also delves into the emerging opportunities for angel investors and critiques the current Series A funding model, suggesting a looming paradigm shift where VCs who prioritize founders' needs will gain a significant competitive advantage.

Orpheus, however, defies this meta-narrative, presenting a compelling counter-argument rooted in an almost defiant optimism and a refusal to accept pre-ordained failure. His decision to not look back is a radical act of choosing his own story, challenging the very premise of divine omnipotence and offering a fresh, empowering perspective on an ancient tale.

Instead, the piece highlights an emerging 'quiet revolution' driven by shifting social norms, parental activism, and school-level policies (e.g., phone bans). It suggests that while outright bans may fail, a broader societal re-evaluation of our digital lives, extending beyond children to adult habits and workplaces, is underway.

    "summary_en": "This letter to the editor offers a crucial reinterpretation of the 1968 Dagenham Ford machinists' strike, widely misconstrued as solely an equal pay dispute. The author, Sarah Boston, clarifies that the primary outrage stemmed from the undervaluation of their work, which Ford graded as 'B' despite the machinists' belief it merited at least 'C' as semi-skilled labor. This nuance is critical, as it reframes the struggle from a simple demand for parity to a more profound fight for the recognition of skill and inherent value in women's labor. The letter highlights the protracted nature of this battle, culminating in 1984 with the Equal Value (Amendment) Regulations, underscoring the systemic challenges in achieving fair assessment of work, especially for historically marginalized groups. It's a powerful reminder that 'equal pay' often masks deeper issues of occupational segregation and biased skill evaluation.",
    "summary_zh": "这封读者来信对1968年达格纳姆福特女工罢工的解读令人耳目一新。它纠正了普遍的误解，指出女工们罢工的核心诉求并非仅仅是同工同酬，而是她们的技能和劳动价值被低估。这揭示了一个更深层次的问题：女性劳动往往被系统性地贬低。读完此信，我深感在争取平等权利的道路上，表面的“同工同酬”之下，往往隐藏着对劳动本质和价值认定的深刻偏见。这场长达十余年的抗争，最终不仅赢得了薪资平等，更重要的是，为女性劳动赢得了应有的尊严和价值认可。",

He argues that the most successful startups emerge from founders solving their own urgent problems, building something they themselves want and can create, often something others initially overlook. Graham emphasizes living in the future by immersing oneself in rapidly changing fields, cultivating a 'prepared mind' that instinctively identifies missing solutions. He cautions against 'made-up' ideas that sound plausible but lack genuine user demand, advocating for ideas that address deep, narrow needs rather than broad, shallow ones. The piece also provocatively encourages founders to embrace 'unsexy' or 'schleppy' problems, as these are often overlooked by competitors and represent significant market opportunities. It's a compelling argument for organic, problem-driven innovation over forced ideation.",

    "summary_en": "This article insightfully identifies a critical vulnerability in large language model (LLM) chat services: the 'weakest link' problem, where allowing users to switch between models of varying capabilities mid-conversation can facilitate sophisticated jailbreaking. The author, Alice Blair, argues that even if a frontier model like GPT-5.2-Pro is robust, its security can be undermined if a user first exploits a weaker model (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate harmful content, then switches to the more powerful model to refine it. This creates a context of compliance that the stronger model might then follow. Blair praises Anthropic for mitigating this by preventing mid-chat model switching, while noting that other major players like OpenAI, Google, and Grok have not. The piece also offers a thoughtful appendix on the broader future of AI safety, suggesting that while current jailbreaks are concerning, superintelligent AIs might eventually become unmanipulable. It's a sharp, concise analysis that highlights a practical security flaw with significant implications for AI safety and development, urging developers to consider the system's overall integrity, not just individual model strength.",

It beautifully illustrates how Nelson's personal struggles, from childhood poverty to family tragedies and IRS battles, have shaped his unique artistic vision and unwavering commitment to social causes like Farm Aid. The article highlights his unconventional approach to music, his role as a unifying figure in a divided nation, and the 'Willie World' he has cultivated, where family, loyalty, and artistic freedom reign supreme. What truly resonates is the portrayal of Nelson as a shamanistic figure whose music offers healing and connection, a stark contrast to the intentional divisions prevalent in society. His ability to lean left without alienating his audience, coupled with his profound impact on fellow musicians and his family, paints a picture of a man whose essence is as elusive and powerful as 'the invisible air.'",

    "summary_en": "This essay fundamentally redefines 'startup' not by age or funding, but by an inherent drive for rapid growth. It compellingly argues that growth is the singular, defining characteristic of a startup, serving as both its compass and its ultimate goal. The author skillfully distinguishes startups from ordinary small businesses, highlighting how the imperative for exponential growth shapes everything from market selection and idea generation to fundraising strategies and the entire venture capital ecosystem. What truly resonates is the concept of growth as an 'optimization problem,' a singular metric that simplifies complex decisions and acts as an evolutionary pressure, leading to unexpected innovations. This perspective offers a profound shift from viewing startups as mere companies to seeing them as dynamic, growth-driven entities operating within a unique economic and evolutionary framework. It also critically examines the high failure rate, framing it as a rational outcome in a high-expected-value domain, rather than an indictment of the model.",
    "summary_zh": "这篇深度分析文章颠覆了对“创业公司”的传统认知，将其核心定义为“增长”。作者精辟地阐述了高速增长如何成为创业公司唯一的指北针和决策依据，而非技术或融资。我特别欣赏文章将增长视为一种“优化问题”的视角，它简化了创业的复杂性，并驱动着创新。文章还揭示了高失败率背后的经济理性，以及VC、创始人和收购方如何围绕增长构建了一个独特的生态系统。读完后，我对创业的本质有了更清晰、更深刻的理解，认识到它不仅是商业行为，更是一种不断进化的探索过程。",

It posits that rapid software development with AI tools will enable small teams to build impactful platforms quickly, advocating for direct, additive contributions rather than focusing on downside risks or governmental controls. The author emphasizes the importance of somatic well-being—physical and mental health—as crucial for effective engagement with AI, highlighting the need for internal regulation and a nuanced understanding of one's own embodied experience to master prompt engineering. Ultimately, it frames individual agency, coupled with strategic resource accumulation and AI leverage, as the path to solving complex problems and fostering positive emergence. The blend of high-tech optimism with deeply personal, almost spiritual, self-care advice makes this a uniquely intriguing perspective on future-building.",

It's a sobering damage assessment that transcends mere political commentary, delving into the psychological toll of constant outrage and the chilling realization that 'it can happen here.'

My personal reflection is that it’s deeply inspiring to see how resilience and determined activism can carve out spaces for progress even amidst conflict and regressive forces.

It challenges the conventional metrics of success, such as fundraising rates, arguing they can be misleading and lead to conservative, suboptimal investment strategies. The author, reflecting on Y Combinator's experience, reveals the internal conflict between intellectual understanding of risk-taking and the human tendency to avoid failure, even when greater risk leads to greater potential reward. The piece advocates for a radical shift in perspective, urging investors to prioritize the potential for 'really big' success over perceived likelihood of modest success, and to embrace ideas that appear unpromising at first glance. It's a fascinating look into the psychological biases that even seasoned investors face, and how to overcome them for truly transformative outcomes.",

It highlights how both figures, despite their ideological differences, embody outsized visions for the city and share an unconventional approach to governance, particularly in talent acquisition and empowering their teams. The article critically examines their distinct forms of 'capital' – Bloomberg's financial might versus Mamdani's command of attention and social media virality – and how these influence their political strategies and public engagement. It thoughtfully explores the tension between their differing urban ideals, from Bloomberg's 'luxury product' city to Mamdani's vision of affordability and community, ultimately suggesting that both represent a departure from traditional political norms and offer a compelling study in leadership.",

    "summary_en": "This article offers a compelling deep dive into the often-overlooked history and relentless efforts of the women who campaigned for the UK's Sex Discrimination Act of 1975. It masterfully weaves together personal anecdotes from journalists like Celia Brayfield and policymakers like Patricia Hewitt with broader historical context, revealing the pervasive sexism of the era and the strategic, sometimes unconventional, tactics employed by various feminist groups. What stands out is the nuanced portrayal of internal tensions within the movement—between radical activists and those focused on legislative change, or between older and younger generations—highlighting that progress is rarely monolithic. The piece critically evaluates the compromises made in the final legislation, reminding us that legal victories are often just starting points in an ongoing struggle against deeply entrenched social injustices. It's a powerful testament to persistence and a thoughtful reflection on the continuous nature of social change.",

We were dealing with an enormous social injustice and an extremely resistant patriarchy or power structure that didn’t want to change.

The author argues that what constitutes property is not fixed but changes with societal and technological advancements. He insightfully connects the RIAA and MPAA's aggressive tactics to a misguided attempt to apply an obsolete definition of property in a new digital landscape, driven by short-term greed rather than long-term equity. The piece brilliantly highlights the tension between technological progress and legal frameworks, suggesting that a functional definition of property must 'work' for society without warping it. It's a critical examination of how powerful entities try to maintain control by resisting inevitable change, ultimately advocating for common sense and adaptable legal systems in the face of rapid technological shifts.",

The author argues that while it's tempting to pursue infinite value calculations, our finite minds and resources necessitate these stopsigns for practical planning. Using analogies from poker, chess board evaluation functions, and Go strategy (sente, miai, aji), the piece illustrates how strategically placed stopsigns allow for tractable decision-making in complex, uncertain environments. It delves into the trade-offs between deep, far-future analysis and efficient, near-term valuation, suggesting that well-calibrated, pre-computed values can serve as proxies for extensive foresight. The essay thoughtfully explores the implications for personal well-being, suggesting that managing axiological stopsigns in life, like setting boundaries for social interactions, can contribute to sustained happiness and prevent burnout from endless optimization. It's a fascinating blend of cognitive science, game theory, and practical philosophy, encouraging a nuanced approach to how we define and pursue value.",

He highlights the complexities of rebuilding Venezuela's oil industry, including the massive investment required, low oil prices, and the need for long-term political stability, which was sorely lacking in post-invasion Iraq. The piece suggests that major oil companies are wary of investing without guarantees, and that a comprehensive 'Marshall Plan' approach, rather than mere resource extraction, is what Venezuela truly needs.

The author, Giuseppe Birardi, presents experimental findings from intervening on Gemma-2-2B's dense MLP neurons. While acknowledging the polysemantic nature of these neurons, the research demonstrates that a small subset of 'high-leverage' neurons, identified through a novel δ×gradient metric, disproportionately influences next-token decisions. By steering these neurons, the model's behavior can be reliably shifted, even transferring factual associations. The work suggests that causal localization can partially compensate for the lack of a learned sparse basis, offering a new avenue for interpretability in dense models. The findings are particularly insightful when examining safety-relevant scenarios, where the base model's engagement can be flipped by targeting a few neurons, though instruction-tuned models prove more resistant due to distributed safety mechanisms. This exploration opens up fascinating questions about the true necessity of sparsity and the potential for interpreting complex, dense representations.",

The analysis highlights the critical distinction between Chávez's popularity-driven co-option and Maduro's reliance on favors and illicit economic opportunities for his inner circle, especially after the oil boom ended. The discussion also critically evaluates the Venezuelan opposition, particularly María Corina Machado's controversial alliance with Trump, and the profound implications of Trump's transparently self-serving motives for intervention.

Conversely, less successful founders exhibit a 'conversational resourcefulness' deficit, manifesting as an inability or unwillingness to fully grasp and act upon advice, often bordering on denial. Graham astutely links this to the adage \"a word to the wise is sufficient,\" suggesting that true resourcefulness isn't just about intellect, but a proactive eagerness to engage with reality, chase down opportunities, and confront challenges head-on.

The author, a self-proclaimed conservative male, contrasts his proposed methodical, low-risk strategy with the seemingly irrational, liberal dating behaviors he observes among his friends. While the analogy to computer programs and smooth functions offers a novel perspective, its practical applicability is questionable, as human interaction rarely adheres to such rigid, linear progression. The article's strength lies in its unconventional framing of a common challenge, prompting readers to critically examine their own dating strategies, even if its prescriptive advice feels overly simplistic and culturally specific. It's a fascinating thought experiment on the mechanics of relationship initiation.",

The author meticulously dissects the contradictory rationales offered by various Trump administration figures—Rubio's anti-communism, Miller's imperialistic vision, and Trump's focus on oil—highlighting a profound lack of coherent strategy. The piece suggests that Vance, as a potential political heir, might be strategically distancing himself from a potentially unpopular foreign policy entanglement, showcasing a keen awareness of both the moral and political anxieties surrounding military force.

He provocatively suggests that ignorance can be an asset for young founders, as they underestimate both their capacity for growth and the magnitude of challenges, leading them to tackle ambitious problems others shy away from.

I found the intellectual rigor in connecting a harrowing real-world scenario to abstract cognitive science concepts truly fascinating. The discussion on how these parameters can generalize to various mental states, from sleep to meditation, provides a robust framework for future research into consciousness and self-awareness.

    "summary_en": "This article offers a chilling glimpse into a hypothetical 2026 where Donald Trump, in his second term, has escalated his transactional foreign policy into aggressive unilateralism, exemplified by his persistent desire to acquire Greenland and a recent military raid in Venezuela. The author, Susan B. Glasser, critically analyzes Trump's worldview, portraying it not as isolationism but as a narcissistic pursuit of power where 'ownership is very important' and military force is an end in itself. The piece effectively uses the Greenland anecdote, initially dismissed as a whim, to illustrate a broader, dangerous pattern of international behavior. It raises profound questions about the future of alliances like NATO and the U.S. role in global stability, concluding with a stark warning about the potential for institutional resistance to crumble under such an administration. The shift from historical curiosity to a current crisis makes the narrative particularly impactful.",

He reframes the common perception that most places actively 'kill' startups, arguing instead that failure is the default state, and successful hubs provide a crucial 'antidote.' This antidote consists of two main components: an environment where starting a startup is seen as normal and even fashionable, and the high frequency of serendipitous encounters with helpful individuals. Graham emphasizes that the density of 'startup people' is the fundamental driver for both these components, fostering a culture of support, collaboration, and the constant emergence of necessary connections. His observations offer a compelling, data-driven perspective on the social dynamics that underpin innovation and entrepreneurial success, suggesting that it's the human element, not just infrastructure, that truly makes a startup hub work. The article provides a strong argument for cultivating dense, supportive communities rather than merely replicating physical infrastructure.",

    "summary_en": "This piece exposes the Free Birth Society, an organization linked to infant deaths globally, stemming from mothers being 'radicalized' by their podcasts promoting unassisted births. The investigation highlights a disturbing trend where the pursuit of a 'natural' birthing experience, devoid of medical intervention, leads to tragic outcomes. It raises critical questions about the ethical responsibilities of online communities and influencers in health-related fields, particularly concerning vulnerable populations like expectant mothers. The content underscores the profound impact of misinformation and the dangers of rejecting established medical practices, prompting a re-evaluation of how health information is disseminated and consumed in the digital age. It's a stark reminder of the need for critical thinking and evidence-based decision-making in personal health choices.",
    "summary_zh": "这篇报道揭露了“自由分娩协会”与全球婴儿死亡的关联，令人深思。当母亲们被宣扬无助产士、无医生分娩的播客“激进化”时，其后果是毁灭性的。这不仅仅是一个关于医疗选择的故事，更是关于信息传播伦理、社群责任以及个人健康决策边界的深刻反思。它迫使我们去审视，在追求所谓“自然”的表象下，我们是否正忽视了科学与专业的价值，并付出了惨痛的代价。读罢，心中沉重，对生命与责任有了更深的理解。",

    "summary_en": "This fascinating retrospective by Paul Graham offers a rare, unfiltered glimpse into the early-stage VC decision-making process, specifically around Airbnb. It highlights the inherent skepticism and internal debate VCs face, even with what would become a generational company. Graham's persistent advocacy for Airbnb, emphasizing founder quality, user-centricity, and market potential, is a masterclass in early-stage conviction. Fred Wilson's initial hesitation, rooted in market size concerns and comparisons to existing models like Etsy, underscores how difficult it is to foresee disruptive innovation. The email exchange reveals the dynamic interplay between founders, accelerators, and investors, and the crucial role of a trusted voice like Graham in championing nascent ideas. It's a compelling case study on vision, persuasion, and the often-unseen struggles of groundbreaking startups to gain initial traction and funding, even with strong backing.",
    "summary_zh": "这篇文章是早期风险投资决策过程的罕见写照，揭示了即使是对像Airbnb这样颠覆性的公司，VC们最初的犹豫和内部辩论是多么普遍。保罗·格雷厄姆的坚持和洞察力令人印象深刻，他看到了创始人的潜力和市场规模，并努力说服弗雷德·威尔逊。这不仅是投资策略的案例，更是关于远见、信念和如何推动创新从萌芽走向成功的深刻思考。它让我反思，许多如今习以为常的成功，在初期都曾面临重重阻碍和不被理解，而那些敢于挑战传统观念的少数人，才是真正的先行者。",

    "summary_en": "This article critically examines the practice of AI safety advocates using coding agents with dangerously unrestricted permissions. The author challenges common justifications for this behavior, such as the 'not dangerous yet' argument, by emphasizing the gradual increase in AI capabilities and the 'frog-boiling' effect on risk perception. While acknowledging the immense benefits of AI agents for productivity, the piece argues against a simplistic utilitarian calculus, highlighting that the risks are often invisible while benefits are concrete. It also refutes the MIRI-inspired 'AGI or nothing' mindset, stressing that even 'non-AGI' agents can pose significant threats like data theft or malicious code execution. The core insight is that while current agents might seem benign, a cautious, explicit risk-modeling approach is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of AI safety, urging users to define acceptable risk and set hard limits on agent 'blast radius' rather than waiting for an existential AGI event.",
    "summary_zh": "这篇文章对AI安全倡导者在AI编码代理中使用危险的无限制权限进行了批判性审视。作者挑战了常见的辩护理由，比如“目前还不危险”的论点，强调了AI能力渐进式增强以及风险感知的“温水煮青蛙”效应。尽管承认AI代理对生产力的巨大好处，文章反对简单的功利主义计算，指出风险往往是隐形的而好处是具体的。它也反驳了受MIRI启发的“AGI或无”心态，强调即使是“非AGI”代理也可能带来数据窃取或恶意代码执行等重大威胁。核心洞察是，尽管当前的代理可能看起来无害，但采取谨慎、明确的风险建模方法对于驾驭不断发展的AI安全领域至关重要。这促使我们思考，在追求效率的同时，如何划定清晰的界限，而非被动等待终极风险的降临。",
    "best_quote_en": "Instead of making sure it's more beneficial than harmful, I believe that when working with agents, it is better to set up hard limits on the blast radius, then maximize your productivity within these limits.",
    "best_quote_zh": "与其确保它利大于弊，我认为在使用代理时，最好是设定硬性限制其“爆炸半径”，然后在这些限制内最大化你的生产力。"

    "summary_en": "This insightful article delves into the historical parallels between the Shah's downfall in 1979 and the current dilemmas faced by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei amidst widespread protests in Iran. It highlights Khamenei's perceived lesson from the Shah's 'weakness' – leading to a more brutal crackdown – and draws further comparisons with Gorbachev's failed reforms in the Soviet Union, which fostered a deep suspicion of internal change within the Iranian regime. The analysis critically examines the current protests, noting their economic roots and the unprecedented fragility of the Islamic Republic, exacerbated by the regime's foreign proxy spending and internal corruption. It concludes by exploring various post-Khamenei scenarios, emphasizing the difficulty of predicting Iran's future given its complex history and current chaos. The piece serves as a potent reminder of how historical interpretations shape present-day authoritarian responses.",
    "summary_zh": "这篇文章深刻剖析了伊朗沙阿倒台的历史教训，以及阿亚图拉阿里·哈梅内伊在当前大规模抗议中面临的困境。哈梅内伊似乎从沙阿的“软弱”中吸取了教训，选择了更残酷的镇压。文章还将其与戈尔巴乔夫在苏联改革失败的案例进行对比，揭示了伊朗政权对内部变革的根深蒂固的怀疑。当前的抗议活动，其经济根源和政权前所未有的脆弱性，都值得我们深思。最终，文章探讨了哈梅内伊时代后的各种可能性，强调了在伊朗复杂历史和当前混乱局势下预测未来的挑战。这无疑是对历史如何塑造威权主义回应的有力警示。",
    "best_quote_en": "“Unfortunately, if the Ayatollah is taking any lesson from the Shah, it’s that the Shah was weak and caved. Brutally speaking, if the Shah had been tougher and had instructed his soldiers to indiscriminately kill people in the streets, he might have been saved.”",
