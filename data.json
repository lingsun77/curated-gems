    "summary_en": "This documentary offers a powerful and inspiring look at the often-overlooked role of women during the 1984-85 miners' strike in the UK. The film highlights how working-class women, many of them miners' wives, organized under Women Against Pit Closures (WAPC) to support the strike through picketing, fundraising, and political activism. Their stories reveal the transformative power of collective action and how this experience politicized many of them, leading to lifelong engagement in community leadership. The documentary challenges the dominant narrative of the strike, which often centers on male miners, and provides a nuanced perspective on working-class women's history. It's a poignant reminder of how grassroots movements can empower individuals and communities, and how political engagement can begin from the most personal of motivations - feeding one's children. The film also serves as a critique of Thatcher's policies and the lasting impact they had on these women's lives.",

While she faced immense challenges including misogyny and racism, her constant criticism of colleagues, staff, and even her husband creates a tone that feels petty rather than humanizing. The book's most striking revelation may be Harris's admission that she passed over Pete Buttigieg as VP because she doubted America's readiness for a ticket with both a Black woman and a gay man. Her critique of Biden's campaign struggles feels muted compared to her harsh judgments of others. The memoir's greatest failure is its lack of generosity toward fellow Democrats at a time when unity is crucial. In focusing on personal grievances, Harris misses an opportunity to present herself as the unifying leader her party desperately needs in the face of Trump's dangerous second term.",

The article suggests that the rise in solo female travel is driven by a desire for autonomy and unique experiences, particularly in adventurous activities like hiking and cycling.

The personal anecdotes and practical advice make it accessible even to beginners, while the beautiful photography and sturdy construction add to its appeal. The second, 'We Stand on Guard,' is a gripping military sci-fi graphic novel that flips the script on invasion narratives, placing Canada as the victim of a US-led water resource grab. The story is intense and thought-provoking, using humor and speculative tech to explore themes of occupation, resistance, and shifting allegiances. Both pieces are rich in detail and offer unique perspectives on their respective subjects.",

The author argues that this obsessive interest is often dismissed as pointless by others but is crucial for making groundbreaking discoveries. The theory suggests that such obsession serves as both a proxy for ability and a substitute for determination. The essay explores how this obsession leads to new ideas by allowing individuals to explore paths others ignore, and discusses the risks and rewards of pursuing seemingly unpromising interests. It also touches on how this theory can explain why different people excel in different fields and how it might be used to encourage great work, particularly in education.",

The discussion covers key concepts like loss aversion, the winner's curse, and the importance of fairness in economic decisions. Kokonas shares practical examples from his business ventures, demonstrating how behavioral economics principles can be applied to solve real-world problems. The conversation also touches on the replication crisis in psychology and the enduring relevance of behavioral economics anomalies.

    "summary_en": "This article explores a critical counterfactual: what if major U.S. law firms had resisted Trump's executive orders rather than quickly capitulating? The piece draws a powerful parallel to Marlon Brando's famous speech in 'On the Waterfront,' highlighting how the failure to protect institutions we owe a duty to has enabled Trump's erosion of legal norms. The author argues that law firms, which play a crucial role in upholding the legal system, had a unique responsibility to resist. Instead, firms like Paul, Weiss settled quickly, providing pro-bono services to the administration in exchange for lifting restrictions. This capitulation sent a signal to other firms and emboldened Trump's assault on the rule of law. The piece suggests that collective action among law firms could have provided momentum to defend legal principles.",

By examining the trajectory of a startup's finances, Graham highlights how many founders fail to ask this crucial question until it's too late, leading to the 'fatal pinch'—a situation where slow growth and insufficient runway combine to doom the company. The essay emphasizes the dangers of overhiring, a common pitfall that exacerbates financial woes rather than solving them. Graham advocates for founders to start asking this question early and to have a clear plan B, as relying solely on investor funding is perilous. The piece also underscores the importance of focusing on product-market fit over rapid scaling, using Airbnb's early days as a case study. Ultimately, Graham's analysis serves as a wake-up call for founders to prioritize sustainability and adaptability over reckless growth.",

The article delves into various paradoxes such as Pascal's Wager and Pascal's Mugging, highlighting the absurdities and exploitative potential of unbounded utility functions. The author argues for the practical and ontological benefits of bounded utility functions, suggesting that they provide clarity and prevent agents from being easily exploited. The discussion extends to real-world applications and the intuitive understanding of utility maximization, making a compelling case for the adoption of bounded utility functions.",
